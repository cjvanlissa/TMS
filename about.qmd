The *Theory Methods Society* was founded by Caspar van Lissa and Noah van Dongen, who received NWO Vidi- and Veni-grants, respectively, for research on theory methods in the social sciences. Both applied for funds to advance community building, which will be used to kick-start this society.

The bylaws and governance structure of the society will be established in due course, most likely during the planned Lorentz workshop on theory methods.

By participating in the *Theory Methods Society*, you agree to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), a code of conduct designed to ensure safety and accountability in communities.
