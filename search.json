    "text": "We are excited to announce the very first edition of the summer school Theory Building in Psychology, organized by the Theory Methods Society, hosted at the University of Amsterdam. Join us for a tour de force in diverse approaches to theory construction from July 6 to July 10 (2026)!\n\n\nIn recent years, psychology has entered what many call a theory crisis: an urgent need to strengthen how we develop and evaluate psychological theories. This summer school serves as an introduction to contemporary approaches addressing this challenge. Throughout the week, leading experts in methodology and theoretical psychology will guide participants through diverse strategies for building, evaluating, and improving psychological theories. The program combines lectures, interactive discussions, and hands-on exercises designed to integrate conceptual reflection (e.g., the structure and function of psychological theories) with practical tools for theory building. By the end of the week, participants will have a deeper understanding of what makes a theory transparent, robust, and explanatory.\n\n\n\nAfter the summer school, participants will be able to:\n\nReflect on the role and value of theory and formal models in psychological research\nLink data, phenomena, models, and theories in a coherent framework\nApply tools and techniques for theory construction\nExperiment with formal models\nQuestion their own theoretical assumptions\nDerive and test falsifiable hypotheses from theories\n\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of conceptual clarification and phenomena\nProblems with ambiguous theories and how to address them\nPerspectives on prediction and explanation\nThe promise and challenges of analogical modelling\nAn introduction to causal loop diagrams, dynamical systems, and agent-based modelling\nThe value and pitfalls of formal models used in contemporary psychological research\nNew developments in the field to improve psychological theory\n\n\n\n\nThis summer school is specifically made for doctoral students (i.e., PhDs) who are familiar with the programming language R. Participants are expected to bring their own laptop. Familiarity with mathematics beyond high school level is not required. If you do not fulfill these requirements, registration is at your own risk.\n\n\n\n800.00 euros. The costs include participation in all lectures and practical sessions (from 09:00 to 17:00), lunch, drinks on Monday, and dinner on Thursday.\n\n\n\nYou can apply for the summer school via this registration link. We can accommodate a maximum of 45 participants. Please note that participants will be selected on a first-come, first-served basis, and registration is only confirmed after you have received an email from us. We maintain a waiting list for participants who sign up beyond the first 45. You can expect to receive information regarding your registration in April (2026). If fewer than 22 participants sign up, the summer school can unfortunately not take place.\n\n\n\nTo receive updates on the summer school, sign up for the mailing list here.\n\n\n\nFor any questions, please email theorysummerschool@googlegroups.com"

His expertise lies in advanced text mining techniques and language models for retrieving information from scholarly papers. His PhD project aims to automate the generation and analysis of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that capture cause-effect relationships. Through these graphs, he seeks to uncover hidden patterns and latent theoretical structures, refining existing theories and aiding in the development of new ones."

The goal of our research is to develop and harness methods to capture and model the immense complexity of mental health and illness (with a focus on suicide and other forms of self-harm, including nonsuicidal self-injury and eating disorders). Our work is interdisciplinary by nature. We integrate methods from across the clinical and computational sciences, including machine learning, mathematical modeling, and digital phenotyping."

His empirical work focuses on ‘hidden talents’, abilities enhanced by adversity, and ‘reasonable responses’, decisions and behavior tailored to the demands of adverse environments. In his theoretical work, he uses mathematical modeling to understand how adaptive processes operating on different timescales—evolution, development, and learning—tailor individuals to their environments."
