Before his current position, he worked at Utrecht University (2020-2023) and Radboud University (2012-2020). He studies how people develop in harsh and unpredictable conditions. His empirical work focuses on ‘hidden talents’, abilities enhanced by adversity, and ‘reasonable responses’, decisions and behavior tailored to the demands of adverse environments. In his theoretical work, he uses mathematical modeling to understand how adaptive processes operating on different timescales—evolution, development, and learning—tailor individuals to their environments."
