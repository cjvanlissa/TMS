    "text": "The Theory Methods Society is a new scholarly community dedicated to advancing theory development across the (social) sciences. We strive to bring together researchers from diverse disciplines who share a commitment to building, refining, and reusing theory, or developing the methods to do so.\nWhether you are developing novel theoretical frameworks, exploring computational modeling, or seeking better ways to integrate theory and data, our society provides a platform for connecting with like-minded others, critical engagement, and methodological innovation. Join us in shaping the future of theory in the social sciences!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us if you have an interest in:\n\n\n\n\nTheory development\nFormal theories\nToy models\nPhilosophy of science\n(Interpretable) machine learning\nSimulation studies\nMeta-science\nOpen science"

    "text": "The Theory Methods Society was founded by Caspar van Lissa and Noah van Dongen, who received NWO Vidi- and Veni-grants, respectively, for research on theory methods in the social sciences. Both applied for funds to advance community building, which will be used to kick-start this society.\nThe bylaws and governance structure of the society will be established in due course, most likely during the planned Lorentz workshop on theory methods.\nBy participating in the Theory Methods Society, you agree to adhere to the Contributor Covenant, a code of conduct designed to ensure safety and accountability in communities."
