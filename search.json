We strive to bring together researchers from diverse disciplines who share a commitment to building, refining, and reusing theory, or developing the methods to do so.\nWhether you are developing novel theoretical frameworks, exploring computational modeling, or seeking better ways to integrate theory and data, our society provides a platform for connecting with like-minded others, critical engagement, and methodological innovation. Join us in shaping the future of theory in the social sciences!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us if you have an interest in:\n\n\n\n\nTheory development\nFormal theories\nToy models\nPhilosophy of science\n(Interpretable) machine learning\nSimulation studies\nMeta-science\nOpen science"
