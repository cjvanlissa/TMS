# By-laws of the Theory Methods Society (TMS)

Version 1.0.0 (September 2025)


## Context

Research on Theory is gaining momentum in the social sciences; there is a critical mass of scholars to establish a society dedicated to the topic. Caspar van Lissa and Noah van Dongen both acquired funds to establish (under different names) a "Theory Methods Society" (TMS); they decided to join forces and recruit early adopters. The Lorentz workshop "Taskforce Theoretical Psychology", organized in September 2025, offers a timely opportunity to formalize the organizational structure of the TMS and set a course for its future. This document is a first draft of the bylaws for the TMS, and we actively invite community feedback to further improve it.
 

## Article 1. Denomination and Domicile

The Theory Methods Society (hereafter referred to as TMS) is a scholarly society that unites researchers, educators, and practitioners with an interest in advancing theoretical and methodological innovation across disciplines and nationalities.

TMS is registered in the Netherlands as a "stichting", i.e., a charitable organization.

## Article 2. Mission and Objectives

The mission of the Theory Methods Society is to build a global scholarly community dedicated to advancing theory development across the social sciences. We strive to bring together researchers from diverse disciplines who share a commitment to building, refining and reusing theory, or developing the methods to do so.

The TMSâ€™ objectives are to:

a. facilitate exchange between scholars working on theoretical and methodological issues;
b. promote education and training in theory and methods;
c. support transparency, rigor, and innovation in research practices.
d. promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and building bridges to other disciplines. 

TMS pursues these objectives by:

a. Ensuring the continued existence of the TMS
b. Growing its membership and engaging in community building
c. Serving members' needs by organizing meetings and providing a platform for knowledge exchange. What members' needs are, and whether the Society succeeds in meeting these, ought to be assessed at least annually.

## Article 3. Membership and Administration

TMS consists of Members, a General Assembly, a TMS Board, and TMS Working Groups.

Membership is open to anyone with an interest in theory and methods who agrees to abide by the bylaws and Code of Conduct, regardless of background, identity, or experience, and regardless of discipline, career stage, or institutional affiliation.

Members are entitled to participate in elections, working groups, and events organized by TMS.

The TMS Board governs a registry of members and affiliated working groups.

## Article 4. Members and Representatives

Each member has one vote in General Assembly meetings.

Members may form local, national, or thematic working groups within TMS. Working groups are established by notification of the Board, which votes on the approval of the working group at the next board meeting. If working groups require funding, their budget must be submitted annually and also be subject to a Board vote.

Each working group selects its own Representative to communicate with the TMS Board.

The Board can set and change membership conditions, dues, and collection policies via a regular majority vote.

Voting regularities are described in Article 8.

## Article 5. TMS Board

The TMS Board (hereinafter referred to as the Board) manages TMS and is legally responsible for the society.

In addition to executing legal obligations associated with managing a charitable organization (Stichting), the Board is responsible for:

a. advancing the mission of TMS;
b. organizing elections and meetings;
c. maintaining external relations;
d. ensuring financial accountability;
e. enforcing the code of conduct, https://berlincodeofconduct.org/en 

The Board roles consist of: 

* A Chair, who oversees meetings, sets agendas, and ensures decisions are implemented.
* A Vice-Chair, who supports and substitutes for the Chair when needed.
* A Treasurer, who manages the finances and prepares budgets and reports.
* A Secretary, who manages internal communications, plans meetings, oversees membership registries, and keeps meeting records.
* A Community Manager, who manages external communication to the members and serves as the point-of-contact for violations of the code of conduct

## Article 6. Elections and Formation of the Board

Board members are elected biannually and serve two-year terms.

All members of TMS are eligible to run for election to the Board.

No Board member may serve more than two consecutive terms.

If vacancies arise mid-term, the Board may either hold an ad hoc election or redistribute responsibilities until the next regular election.

## Article 7. Meetings

The board will organize at least one annual General Assembly of Members, virtually or physically while allowing for virtual attendance.

The Board shall meet at least quarterly, virtually or physically while allowing for virtual attendance.

## Article 8. Decision-Making

Board decisions require a quorum of three board members present. All present Board members have one vote.

General Assembly decisions do not require a quorum as long as the meeting is announced two months in advance and all members, in principle, have an opportunity to participate physically or virtually. All present members of the General Assembly have one vote.

Decisions are made by a simple majority of present (board) members, unless specified otherwise in the bylaws.

In case of a tie in Board decisions, the matter is put to debate, followed by a second vote. If the second vote ends in a tie, the matter is put to a vote in the General Assembly. In case the General Assembly vote results in a tie, the decision is not adopted.

Board decisions may be made outside of meetings if all Board members are consulted in writing.

## Article 9. Termination of Membership

Membership ends when a member either:

a. resigns voluntarily;
b. fails to comply with the TMS Code of Conduct, see Article 13;
c. or is dismissed by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly.

## Article 10. TMS Working Groups

Working Groups are specific projects or communities of practice within TMS.

Any member may propose a Working Group, subject to Board approval.

Working Groups report regularly to the Board and the General Assembly.

## Article 11. Modification of Bylaws

The bylaws may be modified by a two-thirds vote of the Board.

Modifications shall be registered with the legal authorities, if applicable.

## Article 12. Dissolution

The Board may propose the dissolution of TMS. This requires approval by a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly.

In case of dissolution, any remaining funds or assets shall be allocated to an organization with similar aims. 

## Article 13. Code of Conduct

The TMS adopts the Berlin Code of Conduct to ensure a safe and inclusive community, https://berlincodeofconduct.org/en.

The point of contact for reporting CC violations is the Community Manager. The Community Manager solicits written evidence and counterevidence, and - if possible - anonymizes them. 

The Board is presented with the (anonymized) evidence and votes on action to be taken. Enforcement options include:

* A written warning
* Probationary period
* Withdrawal of membership as described under Article 9.
