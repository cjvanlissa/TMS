The **Theory Methods Society** is a new scholarly community dedicated to advancing theory development across the (social) sciences. We strive to bring together researchers from diverse disciplines who share a commitment to building, refining, and reusing theory, or developing the methods to do so.

Join us in shaping the future of theory in the social sciences!
