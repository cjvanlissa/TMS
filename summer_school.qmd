We are excited to announce the very **first edition of the summer school Theory Building in Psychology**, organized by the Theory Methods Society, hosted at the University of Amsterdam. Join us for a tour de force in diverse approaches to theory construction from **July 6 to July 10 (2026)**!

## What To Expect
In recent years, psychology has entered what many call a theory crisis: an urgent need to strengthen how we develop and evaluate psychological theories. This summer school serves as an introduction to contemporary approaches addressing this challenge. Throughout the week, leading experts in methodology and theoretical psychology will guide participants through diverse strategies for building, evaluating, and improving psychological theories. The program combines lectures, interactive discussions, and hands-on exercises to help participants integrate conceptual reflection on psychological theories (e.g., their structure and function) with concrete tools for building them.

## Learning Goals
After the summer school, participants will be able to:

* Reflect on the role and value of theory and formal models in psychological research
* Link data, phenomena, models, and theories in a coherent framework
* Apply tools and techniques for theory building
* Experiment with formal models
* Critically reflect on their own assumptions about the nature and purpose of psychological theories
* Derive and test falsifiable hypotheses from theories

## Covered Topics
The following topics and more will be covered during the summer school:

* The importance of conceptual clarification and phenomena
* Problems with psychology’s predominantly ambiguous theories and how to address them
* Perspectives on prediction and explanation
* The promise and challenges of analogical modelling 
* An introduction to causal loop diagrams, dynamical systems, and agent-based modelling
* The value and pitfalls of formal models used in contemporary psychological research
* New developments in the field to improve psychological theory
